        Hello, I'm Netshiongolwe Thikolelwi, a 21-year-old passionate about
        technology and innovation. I have honed my skills in front-end
        development through SheCodes bootcamps, where I developed a strong
        foundation in coding and web design.

        <br />
        <br />

        Along with my technical expertise, I am a dedicated learner, a
        problem-solver, and a team player who thrives in collaborative
        environments. My goal is to leverage my skills to create impactful and
        user-friendly digital solutions.
